## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bay-area-surf-chap.git
cd bay-area-surf-chap
pip install requests
```

### Setup Your Board Quiver

**Required**: Create `my_boards.json` with your actual surfboards:

```bash
# Copy the example and customize with your boards
cp my_boards_example.json my_boards.json
# Edit with your actual board specifications
```

Or create from scratch:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Your Board Name",
    "length": "5'9\"",
    "width": "21\"",
    "volume": 35.25,
    "type": "fish/hybrid",
    "construction": "libtech",
    "ideal_wave_range": [2, 5],
    "ideal_period_range": [8, 13],
    "description": "Your go-to small wave board"
  }
]
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Get recommendations for Linda Mar
python surfline_forecast.py "Linda Mar"

# Check out Pleasure Point
python surfline_forecast.py "Pleasure Point"

# List all available spots
python surfline_forecast.py --list-spots

# Save raw data for analysis
python surfline_forecast.py "Princeton Jetty" --save-json

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Your Board Quiver

Edit `my_boards.json` to match your actual surfboards:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Your Board Name",
    "length": "5'9\"",
    "width": "21\"",
    "volume": 35.25,
    "type": "fish/hybrid",
    "construction": "libtech",
    "ideal_wave_range": [2, 5],
    "ideal_period_range": [8, 13],
    "description": "Your go-to small wave board"
  }
]
```

### Construction Types

Bay Area Surf Chap includes detailed construction analysis. Edit `board_constructions.json` to add or modify construction types:

```json
{
  "your_construction": {
    "full_name": "Your Construction Name",
    "durability": "high",
    "flex": "medium",
    "paddle_power": "high",
    "small_wave_performance": "excellent",
    "powerful_wave_performance": "good",
    "description": "Description of construction characteristics"
  }
}
```

### Supported Board Types
- `fish/hybrid` - Small wave specialists
- `performance_shortboard` - All-around performance
- `twin_fin` - Playful, skatey feel
- `gun` - Big wave boards
- `step_up` - Powerful wave boards

### Included Construction Types
- **`pu`** - Traditional polyurethane, responsive feel
- **`eps`** - Lightweight EPS/epoxy, great paddle power
- **`libtech`** - Bomb-proof Lib Tech construction
- **`fused_cell_eps`** - EPS core with PU rails (Aipa style)
- **`xtr_parallel_carbon`** - Carbon fiber reinforcement
- **`darkarts`** - Revolutionary carbon fiber vacuum-bagged construction
- **`carbon_kevlar`** - Hybrid carbon-kevlar weave
- **`tuflite`** - Molded Surftech construction

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Fetches Real Data** - Connects to Surfline's API for current conditions
2. **Analyzes Your Quiver** - Scores each board against wave conditions
3. **Considers Spot Characteristics** - Beach breaks favor different boards than reef breaks
4. **Factors Construction** - Libtech boards get bonuses in small waves, PU in powerful waves
5. **Provides Recommendations** - Ranked list with detailed reasoning

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Spots File

The `surf_spots.json` file contains detailed information about each surf spot. You can add new spots or modify existing ones:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Local Break",
  "surfline_id": "your_surfline_id_here",
  "type": "reef_break",
  "characteristics": {
    "wave_quality": "excellent",
    "skill_level": "advanced",
    "best_boards": ["shortboard", "gun"]
  }
}
```

### Integration as a Standalone Tool

Bay Area Surf Chap provides complete surf analysis and board recommendations in one place:

1. Set up your board quiver in `my_boards.json`
2. Run the script for any Bay Area spot
3. Get detailed conditions and board analysis
4. Make informed decisions about your surf session
5. Track conditions over time with the `--save-json` option

**Note**: The script will create default configuration files for constructions and surf spots automatically, but you must create your own board quiver file.

## üìä Scoring Algorithm

Boards are scored on multiple factors:

- **Wave Size Match** (0-3 points) - How well the board handles current wave height
- **Period Compatibility** (0-2 points) - Board performance in current swell period
- **Wind Conditions** (0-1 points) - Clean vs windy condition bonuses
- **Spot-Specific Bonuses** (0-1.5 points) - Beach break vs reef break preferences
- **Construction Bonuses** (0-1 points) - Construction performance in conditions

Maximum score: 8.0 points
